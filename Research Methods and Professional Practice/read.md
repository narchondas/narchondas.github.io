## Learning outcomes


### In the module Research Methods and Professional Practice I shall:

*Acquire the ability to study and reflect on key principles and methods in research based on the scientific method and relevant to various disciplines.

*Acquire the ability to examine various research strategies and designs as applicable to projects at hand.

*Acquire the ability to develop research competencies, in particular those relating to the collection and analysis of data types to enable a critical design and evaluation of independent research.

*Have the opportunity to take a reflective and independent approach to the learning process.


### On completion of the module Research Methods and Professional Practice, I will be able to:

*Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.

*Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.

*Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.

*Produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for the chosen topic.

## Collaborative discussions

### Initial, summary posts & response to peers' posts


### Collaborative Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct



**Initial Post**

The Blocker Plus case study, provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), illustrates the ethical complexity of deploying machine learning systems in socially sensitive contexts. While the system initially aligned with CIPA’s (Children’s Internet Protection Act) legal obligations, the developers breached key provisions of the BCS (British Computer Society) Code of Conduct. Activist groups exploited Blocker Plus’s feedback mechanism to manipulate the machine learning model, leading it to classify legitimate content on gay and lesbian marriage, vaccination, climate change, and other socially relevant topics as harmful to children. The failure to prevent bias and safeguard against malicious data input constituted a violation of the principles of Public Interest, particularly the duty to avoid discrimination and to promote inclusivity (BCS, 2021).

Furthermore, the insufficient transparency and lack of public disclosure regarding the model’s limitations contravened the requirement for Professional Competence and Integrity, as responsible practitioners must ensure compliance with legislation and uphold honesty in technical reporting. The decision to preserve a corrupted model, rather than mitigate harms, also breached their Duty to Relevant Authority by neglecting due diligence and public accountability.

Ethically, this case study underscores the centrality of the principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency to contemporary AI governance frameworks (Fjeld et al., 2020; Finn and Shilton, 2023). It also resonates with the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI, which stresses the necessity of human oversight and explainability as safeguards against algorithmic discrimination. As Kluge Corrêa et al. (2023) observe, the transition from voluntary ethics to binding AI regulation reflects a growing recognition that professional responsibility must be matched by enforceable accountability. This case study exemplifies that professionalism in computing extends beyond legal compliance to the moral stewardship of technology’s societal impact.
