## Learning outcomes


### In the module Intellignet Agents I shall:

*Understand the motivations for, and appropriate use of, agent-based computing.

*Understand the main agent models in use today and their grounding in artificial intelligence research.

*Acquire the knowledge and skills to develop, deploy and evaluate the tools and techniques of intelligent systems to solve real-world problems.

*Understand contemporary research issues in the area of intelligent agent systems.


### On completion of the module Intelligent Agents, I will be able to:

*Identify and critically analyse agent-based systems, differentiating between architectures and approaches.

*Apply and critically evaluate intelligent agent techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.

*Deploy critically appropriate software tools and skills for the design and implementation of an agent-based system, bearing in mind applicable legal, social, ethical and professional issues.

*Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

## Professional Skills matrix and action plan PDP


### Self-assessment

* Very motivated to learn about Intelligent Agents and advance with my MSc.

* Focused on timely delivery of good quality assignments.

* Good with time management, note taking and studying new material.

* Lack of a STEM background, so more difficult to get quickly familiar with the concepts and perform the formative acitivities i.e. coding and Protege exercises.


### Set goals

* Learn to identify and critically analyse agent-based systems, differentiating between architectures and approaches

* Apply and critically evaluate intelligent agent techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.

* Deploy critically appropriate software tools and skills for the design and implementation of an agent-based system, bearing in mind applicable legal, social, ethical and professional issues.

* Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

* Regularly update my GitHub.


### Develop strategies

* Study the required and additional reading of each Module Unit.

* Take e-notes and highlight the most important sections.

* Understand the formative activities and test my knowledge with examples.

* Prepare all seminar activities.

* Perform the required formative activities of the Module Unit.

* Plan in advance for the assignments.

* Make sure there is sufficient time to fine-tune assignments.

* Gather feedback from tutor and peers.


### Gather resources

* Study all the required and additional resources of each Module Unit. 

* Prepare seminar activities.

* Perform all formative activities.

* Seek other explanatory reliable material on internet (websites, videos, classes etc).

* Reach out to the tutor.


### Create timeline

* Study all required and additional material every week.
  
* Plan in advance the assignments.

* Timely deliver the modelling assignment. 

* Timely submit my e-portfolio.


### Track progress and revise

* Regularly monitor if targets are met.

* Reconsider strategy, if needed.

* Monitor the timely delivery of good quality assignments.
