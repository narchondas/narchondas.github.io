### Collaborative Discussion 1



**Agent Based Systems: Discuss what has led to the rise of agent-based systems and the benefits that this approach can offer to organisations.**


**Initial Post**

The rise of agent-based systems is closely tied to the growing complexity of modern computing environments and broader technological trends. Traditional centralised systems are increasingly inadequate for managing dynamic, distributed infrastructures such as supply chains, logistics networks, and smart cities. As highlighted in the lecturecast of Unit 1 (UoEO, n.d.), converging trends like ubiquity, interconnection, intelligence, delegation, and human-orientation have driven the development of systems capable of operating autonomously in uncertain and partially observable environments. The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G networks, and edge computing has created conditions where systems must not only act independently but also coordinate and adapt in real time. Wooldridge (2009) defines agents as computational systems embedded in environments that are capable of flexible, autonomous action in pursuit of delegated objectives, with the ability to act proactively, reactively, and socially.

For organisations, agent-based systems offer improvements in scalability, fault tolerance, and decision-making autonomy. In smart manufacturing, agents support decentralised process control and allow for modular, adaptive production systems (Pulikottil et al., 2023). Logistics operations, such as those pioneered by Amazon’s robotics, demonstrate how multi-agent architectures can increase flexibility and reduce human labour costs (Wasesa et al., 2017). In traffic systems, distributed agents enable responsive and efficient traffic flow control across geographically dispersed networks (Wang, 2005). These systems exemplify Wooldridge’s distinction between agents and passive software: agents possess autonomy, control their own actions, and are capable of collaboration and negotiation to meet shared objectives.

**Summary Post**

The rise of agent-based systems is driven by the growing complexity of modern computing environments and converging technological trends. Centralised systems are increasingly inadequate for managing dynamic, distributed infrastructures such as supply chains, logistics networks, and smart cities. As highlighted in the lecturecast of Unit 1, factors like ubiquity, interconnection, intelligence, delegation, and human-orientation have spurred the development of systems capable of autonomous operation in uncertain and partially observable environments (UoEo, no date). The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and edge computing has created conditions where systems must act independently while coordinating and adapting in real time. Wooldridge (2009) defines agents as computational systems embedded in environments, capable of proactive, reactive, and social behaviour in pursuit of delegated objectives.

For organisations, agent-based systems improve scalability, fault tolerance, and decision-making autonomy. In manufacturing, they enable decentralised process control and adaptive production (Pulikottil et al., 2023). In logistics, multi-agent architectures like Amazon’s robotics enhance flexibility and reduce labour costs (Wasesa, Stam and van Heck, 2017). In traffic management, distributed agents support responsive and efficient flow control (Wang, 2005).

Nonetheless, significant challenges remain. Scalability issues can arise as the number of agents grows, increasing coordination overhead and complexity (Durfee, 2004). When multi-agent systems are spread across many different devices and technologies, it creates more entry points for hackers, making the whole system harder to secure. (Zhang et al., 2025). In healthcare, LLM-based agents face novel risks, including adversarial prompts embedded in online sources that could manipulate medical decisions (Qiu et al., 2025).

Resilience-oriented design can address these issues. In manufacturing, redundant sensors and controllers sustain production if agents fail (Pulikottil et al., 2023). In logistics, authenticated communication and stress testing preserve coordination under pressure (Wasesa, Stam and van Heck, 2017). In traffic systems, anomaly detection and self-healing controls mitigate faulty data and reroute flows automatically (Wang, 2005). Embedding such safeguards is essential to sustaining scalability, reliability, and autonomy (Zhang et al., 2025).

Agent-based systems hold transformative potential for distributed operations, but their long-term success depends on integrating preventive measures and adaptive mechanisms alongside autonomy.

#### Response to my peers' posts

The increasing complexity and decentralised nature of modern systems has created a landscape in which traditional centralised computing models often prove inadequate. In response, agent-based systems (ABS) have become an effective paradigm for modelling environments where independent, interactive components must make decisions in parallel. These systems do not operate in isolation but instead function within a dynamic ecosystem of partially observable and often unpredictable variables (Wooldridge, 2009).

Recent developments in computational infrastructure, particularly in IoT, edge computing, and ubiquitous connectivity, have intensified the need for distributed intelligence. In such environments, ABS enable real-time responsiveness through autonomous agents that exhibit goal-oriented, reactive, and socially cooperative behaviours (UoEO, no date). Their strength lies not only in their independence but also in their ability to interact meaningfully with other agents or human operators to align local actions with broader system objectives.

Notably, the capacity of ABS to manage disruptions is increasingly vital. In manufacturing, for instance, the deployment of agents across modular production units supports adaptive operations, enabling continuity during demand shifts or mechanical failures (Pulikottil et al., 2023). Similarly, agent-driven coordination in logistics enhances flexibility in the face of supply chain volatility (Wasesa et al., 2017).

Furthermore, the integration of adjustable autonomy mechanisms allows agents to assess when human intervention is preferable, particularly in high-risk or uncertain conditions (UoEO, no date). This layered decision model not only reinforces system resilience but also reflects an increasing trust in computational agents to act judiciously within delegated boundaries.

Overall, ABS represent a conceptual and technical evolution toward systems that are capable of distributed control, intelligent adaptation, and collaborative behaviour under complexity.

The argument presented offers a timely assessment of the foundational role agents play in modern computing. The definition cited, according to which agents are systems capable of autonomous action in an environment, resonates strongly with core theoretical frameworks (Wooldridge, 2009). This perspective is further supported by the lecturecast of the Unit 1, which characterises agents as entities that perceive, reason, and act under partial control and incomplete information (UoEO, no date).

The observation that agent capabilities are shaped primarily by the constraints of hardware and software is particularly pertinent. As outlined in the UoEO material (no date), agents range from reactive software daemons and control systems to proactive, learning-enabled systems operating in complex environments such as manufacturing or logistics. This flexibility demonstrates the scalability of agent-based systems and their suitability across both physical and digital domains.

The increasing convergence of agent-based models with generative AI, particularly through large language models, introduces a new dimension of capability. With recent developments such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT agents, computational entities are now being deployed to perform knowledge-based tasks previously limited to human professionals (OpenAI, 2025). While this enhances organisational efficiency and reduces the time and cost associated with complex tasks, it also raises important questions around over-reliance and the need for human oversight.

In sum, the post effectively identifies both the technical robustness and emerging challenges associated with agent-based systems. Their increasing autonomy, versatility, and integration into real-world applications underscore their importance in shaping the future of intelligent systems.

### Collaborative Discussion 2



**Agent Communication Languages: What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of the use of agent communication languages such as KQML? How do they compare with method invocation in Python or Java?**


**Initial Post**

The use of agent communication languages (ACLs), such as the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML), provides several potential advantages compared with traditional method invocation in Python or Java. First, ACLs are explicitly designed to support communication between autonomous agents, enabling richer forms of interaction inspired by speech act theory, where messages can function as requests, commitments, or declarations rather than simple function calls (Searle, 1969; Finin et al., 1994). This makes ACLs well-suited for open, distributed environments where heterogeneous agents must negotiate, cooperate, or share knowledge without being tightly coupled to a single interface or platform (Wooldridge, 2009).

A second advantage lies in flexibility and autonomy: whereas a method call deterministically executes a specified piece of code, an ACL message allows the receiving agent to decide whether and how to respond, reflecting its goals and local constraints. This distinction highlights the difference between object-oriented invocation and agent-based communication, objects “do it for free,” but agents “do it because they want to” (Wooldridge, 2009).

Nonetheless, ACLs also present notable disadvantages. KQML, for example, suffered from weak standardisation and interoperability problems due to loosely defined semantics and inconsistent implementations (Finin et al., 1994). Additionally, agent communication requires ontology alignment to avoid semantic heterogeneity, a non-trivial challenge when different agents operate with incomplete or private vocabularies (Payne and Tamma, 2014). Finally, ACLs introduce computational overhead compared with lightweight method calls, potentially reducing performance in high-frequency exchanges.

In sum, ACLs prioritise autonomy and expressiveness in distributed systems, but these benefits are balanced by complexity, semantic uncertainty, and efficiency trade-offs.

**Summary Post**

The use of agent communication languages (ACLs), such as the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML), offers distinct advantages over traditional method invocation in languages such as Python or Java. ACLs are grounded in speech act theory, which frames communication as more than the execution of functions: messages may serve as requests, commitments, or declarations (Searle, 1969; Finin et al., 1994). This expressiveness makes ACLs particularly well-suited for open, distributed systems, where heterogeneous agents must cooperate, negotiate, or exchange knowledge without relying on tightly coupled interfaces (Wooldridge, 2009).

A key advantage of ACLs lies in the autonomy they confer. Whereas method calls deterministically execute specified code, ACL messages empower agents to decide whether and how to respond in accordance with their goals and constraints. As Wooldridge (2009) notes, objects “do it for free,” but agents “do it because they want to.” This autonomy, as further emphasised by Jennings, Sycara and Wooldridge (1998), underpins negotiation-based problem solving in distributed environments, thereby enabling more adaptive forms of interaction than object-oriented invocation alone.

Nevertheless, ACLs also bring challenges. KQML in particular suffered from weak standardisation, leading to interoperability issues due to loosely defined semantics and inconsistent implementations (Finin et al., 1994). Furthermore, effective communication requires ontology alignment to ensure semantic interoperability, yet mismatches in shared vocabularies can undermine otherwise coherent dialogues (Payne and Tamma, 2014). These issues illustrate the trade-offs between expressiveness and efficiency: ACLs enable richer forms of interaction, but at the cost of added complexity, semantic uncertainty, and computational overhead.

In sum, ACLs highlight the difference between object invocation and agent communication, privileging autonomy, negotiation, and semantic richness, but their benefits must be balanced against practical difficulties of implementation and interoperability.

#### Response to my peers' posts



Your post makes an important point about the abstraction and interoperability ACLs such as KQML provide. Building on this, one of their key contributions lies in the grounding of performatives in speech act theory, linking messages to agents’ cognitive states such as belief, knowledge, desire, and intention (Labrou and Finin, 1994; Labrou and Finin, 1997). This means that an ACL message is not merely a data transfer but an expression of intent, enabling richer communicative acts like commitments, negotiations, or declarations.

A second advantage is the structuring of multi-step interactions through 'conversation policies'. These policies formally specify how performatives like ask-if, tell, or sorry can be sequenced, ensuring coherent dialogues across heterogeneous agents (Labrou and Finin, 1997). Such mechanisms extend far beyond conventional method calls, which lack protocol-level semantics and assume deterministic execution.

However, the drawbacks are equally significant. KQML long suffered from a lack of formally defined semantics, resulting in inconsistent implementations and undermining standardisation efforts (Finin et al., 1994). Moreover, agent conversations impose computational overhead compared with lightweight method invocations, and their success ultimately depends on shared ontologies to ensure semantic alignment across domains (Payne and Tamma, 2014). These requirements make ACLs more expressive but also more complex than direct method calls in Python or Java.

In short, ACLs prioritise autonomy and semantic richness, supporting negotiation and cooperation in distributed environments, but this expressiveness is balanced by efficiency costs and unresolved challenges of interoperability.

Your post rightly highlights abstraction and interoperability as central strengths of ACLs such as KQML. I would emphasise, however, one additional but often overlooked advantage: ACLs formalise not only individual messages but also the structure of conversations. Labrou and Finin (1997) demonstrate that KQML provides explicit conversation policies, which define permissible sequences of performatives (e.g., ask-if followed by tell or sorry). This ability to embed protocol-level semantics enables multi-agent systems to sustain coherent dialogues, something method invocation in Python or Java cannot provide, as it remains limited to isolated, deterministic calls.

On the downside, a major limitation of ACLs is precisely the lack of stable semantic standardisation. Early versions of KQML were criticised for relying on loosely defined semantics, which often led to inconsistent implementations and hindered true interoperability across platforms (Finin et al., 1994). Even with later semantic frameworks, effective communication still presupposes agreed ontologies, making ACLs far more fragile in practice than the lightweight reliability of direct method calls.

In this sense, ACLs excel in modelling dialogues between autonomous agents, but their promise of universal interoperability remains constrained by unresolved semantic challenges.
