## Learning outcomes


### In the module Intelligent Agents I shall:

*Understand the motivations for, and appropriate use of, agent-based computing.

*Understand the main agent models in use today and their grounding in artificial intelligence research.

*Acquire the knowledge and skills to develop, deploy and evaluate the tools and techniques of intelligent systems to solve real-world problems.

*Understand contemporary research issues in the area of intelligent agent systems.


### On completion of the module Intelligent Agents, I will be able to:

*Identify and critically analyse agent-based systems, differentiating between architectures and approaches.

*Apply and critically evaluate intelligent agent techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.

*Deploy critically appropriate software tools and skills for the design and implementation of an agent-based system, bearing in mind applicable legal, social, ethical and professional issues.

*Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

## Professional Skills matrix and action plan PDP


### Self-assessment

* Very motivated to learn about Intelligent Agents and advance with my MSc.

* Focused on timely delivery of good quality assignments.

* Good with time management, note taking and studying new material.

* Lack of a STEM background, so more difficult to get quickly familiar with the concepts and perform the formative acitivities i.e. coding and Protege exercises.


### Set goals

* Learn to identify and critically analyse agent-based systems, differentiating between architectures and approaches

* Apply and critically evaluate intelligent agent techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.

* Deploy critically appropriate software tools and skills for the design and implementation of an agent-based system, bearing in mind applicable legal, social, ethical and professional issues.

* Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

* Regularly update my GitHub.


### Develop strategies

* Study the required and additional reading of each Module Unit.

* Take e-notes and highlight the most important sections.

* Understand the formative activities and test my knowledge with examples.

* Prepare all seminar activities.

* Perform the required formative activities of the Module Unit.

* Plan in advance for the assignments.

* Make sure there is sufficient time to fine-tune assignments.

* Gather feedback from tutor and peers.


### Gather resources

* Study all the required and additional resources of each Module Unit. 

* Prepare seminar activities.

* Perform all formative activities.

### Collaborative Discussion 1



**Agent Based Systems: Discuss what has led to the rise of agent-based systems and the benefits that this approach can offer to organisations.**


**Initial Post**

The rise of agent-based systems is closely tied to the growing complexity of modern computing environments and broader technological trends. Traditional centralised systems are increasingly inadequate for managing dynamic, distributed infrastructures such as supply chains, logistics networks, and smart cities. As highlighted in the lecturecast of Unit 1 (UoEO, n.d.), converging trends like ubiquity, interconnection, intelligence, delegation, and human-orientation have driven the development of systems capable of operating autonomously in uncertain and partially observable environments. The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G networks, and edge computing has created conditions where systems must not only act independently but also coordinate and adapt in real time. Wooldridge (2009) defines agents as computational systems embedded in environments that are capable of flexible, autonomous action in pursuit of delegated objectives, with the ability to act proactively, reactively, and socially.

For organisations, agent-based systems offer improvements in scalability, fault tolerance, and decision-making autonomy. In smart manufacturing, agents support decentralised process control and allow for modular, adaptive production systems (Pulikottil et al., 2023). Logistics operations, such as those pioneered by Amazon’s robotics, demonstrate how multi-agent architectures can increase flexibility and reduce human labour costs (Wasesa et al., 2017). In traffic systems, distributed agents enable responsive and efficient traffic flow control across geographically dispersed networks (Wang, 2005). These systems exemplify Wooldridge’s distinction between agents and passive software: agents possess autonomy, control their own actions, and are capable of collaboration and negotiation to meet shared objectives.
