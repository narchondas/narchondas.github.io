## Collaborative Discussion


### Initial & summary posts


**Initial Post**

**Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.  Your post could consider a range of impacts of the failure, including: the implications to customers, the economic cost, the reputational cost, or any other relevant impacts.**

‘System failure is a system that fails to develop or does so in a stunted fashion’ (Carlsson and Jacobsson ,1997 in Bergek et al., 2008).   The first six months of 2018, the national IT systems across the NHS in Wales experienced such system failures as a total of 21 outages took place resulting in various disruptions for GPs, health care staff and patients (Postelnicu, 2018).   

These IT system failures in the Welsh NHS affected appointments, prescriptions and in general the health care provision as the professionals were unable to access electronic patients records for several hours (Donnely, 2018).   Moreover, patients could not book or re-book or cancel their appointments, nor be given test results, whereas GPs could not have access to blood and X-Ray results (BBC, 2018).  Dr Peter Saul, of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said: "Today, IT systems are as critical to clinicians as stethoscopes and scanners. Data outages can be extraordinarily disruptive for practices and for patients’ (Geraint, 2018).

As Schwab (2016) pointed out the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we are now experiencing, is a distinct one compared to the previous as for three components: velocity, scope, and systems impact.  System interdependencies can result in disrupting daily life and industries in every country.  On top of that, there may be a widespread feeling among the population that the extensive availability and circulation of high volumes of both structured and unstructured data has a negative impact on our inner lives and therefore we may lose control over them.
By interdependency is meant ‘a bidirectional relationship between two infrastructures through which the state of each infrastructure influences or is correlated to the state of the other’.  This is why, ‘[…] identifying, understanding, and analysing such interdependencies are significant challenges’, exacerbated by the breadth and complexity of critical IT nationwide infrastructures (Rinaldi et al., 2001).

The Welsh NHS IT system failures had to do with infrastructures which share cyber interdependency (Rinaldi et al., 2001), meaning that their state depends on information transmitted through the information infrastructure.  Eventually, such weaknesses in system structure may lead to interaction failures (related to networks) and to institutional failures (related to institutions) as it was the case of the Welsh NHS outages and may have an impact on the public trust towards state actors and operators.

Realising to what extent governments and public or private databases are vulnerable to failures or to external threats is crucial for how public policies will take shape and public goods will be delivered to citizens in the future.  Concerns about the vulnerability may even make countries roll back their initial plans for full replacement of the physical dimension into the digital one.  ‘Sweden and Norway are backpedalling on plans for cashless societies over fears that fully digital payment systems would leave them vulnerable to Russian security threats, and concern for those unable to use them.  Prolonged power cuts, system failures or digital attacks on payment systems and banks could leave cash as the only alternative that is easily available’ (Bryant, 2024).

**Summary post**

System failures occur when systems fail to develop adequately or remain underdeveloped (Carlsson and Jacobsson, 1997 in Bergek et al., 2008).  In early 2018, the NHS in Wales encountered 21 critical IT system outages, disrupting services for GPs, healthcare staff, and patients (Postelnicu, 2018).  These disruptions hindered access to electronic patient records, affecting appointments, prescriptions, and healthcare delivery (Donnely, 2018).  Patients struggled with booking or cancelling appointments and obtaining test results, while GPs couldn’t access blood test and X-ray data (BBC, 2018).  Dr. Peter Saul from the Royal College of GPs in Wales emphasised the criticality of IT systems to clinical practice, warning of significant disruptions from data outages (Geraint, 2018).

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by unprecedented speed, scope, and systemic impact, leading to complex interdependencies across systems that can disrupt lives and industries globally (Schwab, 2016).  Nevertheless, there is rising concern over how extensive data availability affects personal control and privacy.

Interdependency is defined as ‘a bidirectional relationship between two infrastructures through which the state of each infrastructure influences or is correlated to the state of the other’ (Rinaldi et al., 2001). These connections pose challenges due to the complexity of national IT infrastructures.

The Welsh NHS IT system failures had to do with infrastructures which share cyber interdependency (Rinaldi et al., 2001), meaning that their state depends on information transmitted through the information infrastructure.  Eventually, such weaknesses in system structure may lead to interaction failures (related to networks) and to institutional failures (related to institutions) as it was the case of the Welsh NHS outages and may have an impact on the public trust towards state actors and operators.

However, our infrastructure was already heavily technologised and interdependent nearly 25 years ago, with risks of disruptions cascading across sectors, making it clear that vulnerabilities were present even in the early stages of digital reliance (Rinaldi et al., 2001).  The point is that today, due to the rapid technological advances, such as data integration and cyber-based systems, these complexities are largely amplified (Schwab, 2016).

A key challenge is modernising legacy systems necessary for organisations yet obsolete for Industry 4.0 (Venâncio et al., 2022).  Although Industry 4.0 offers clear benefits, high transformation costs hinder adoption.  Updating systems is vital but complicated by system evolution and integration (Clarke et al., 2024).

Understanding vulnerabilities is vital for future policy development and public service delivery.  Concerns over these vulnerabilities could prompt reconsideration of digital transitions, as seen in Sweden and Norway's re-evaluation of cashless societies due to security threats and accessibility issues (Bryant, 2024).

### Response to my peers' posts


Thanks, Elias, for your insightful post on the data breaches, affecting, in particular, government-run databases, which may be due to cyber-attacks or just IT system failures.   

As Yuchong L. et al. (2021) put it, governments nowadays due to the interconnected cyberspace, we are interacting with, are confronted with multiple and much more complex safety risks than in the past.  For instance, the concept of security is not only military threat to internal or external borders.  The character of the cyber threats and IT systems failure is such that the geographical dimension is not relevant.  In other words, a cyber threat and attack can come from a state or non-state actor far away from the national boundaries.  ‘These threats are sporadic, multidimensional, and because they are associated with sensitive networks and infrastructure, their level of damage is very high’.  This kind of threat requires a different response from governments and private actors alike, which has mainly to do with investing more on IT infrastructure.  Such resources should aim at preserving the databases intact, avoiding as much as possible data leakages and mitigating the impacts if such data breaches or cyber-attacks take place.

Similarly, the National Audit Office in the UK pointed out that changes in the digital service delivery “have mainly focused on improvements to the citizen’s online experience ... Without a deeper understanding of digital transformation, senior leaders often focus on tactical solutions and quick fixes and avoid addressing the underlying inefficiencies that contribute to driving future costs” (Fishenden J. 2024).  The changes referred to, among others, could include designing ‘scalable, secure and resilient systems’. 

On the same issue, Booth R. (2025) concludes that state actors will find it very difficult to successfully address the lack of advanced digital and cyber-skills in the public sector workforce, enhance accountability for cyber-attacks and ‘better manage the risks posed by legacy IT’.  This is why policy and digital transformation need to go hand in hand and be ‘co-designed — managed, developed, and adapted together to reflect and respond to an ever-changing political, legal, social, and economic landscape’.

Dear Jaco,

your insight into IT system failures highlights a critical dimension:  IT failures and data breaches often result not only from cyber-attacks and cyber-threats but also from hastily implemented fixes and insufficiently tested releases.  As you argue in your post, this failure underscores the risks of prioritising rapid release cycles and depending on addressing issues as they emerge in production (Khern-am-nuai, 2024), all in the pursuit of faster time-to-market for competitive advantage.  In such scenarios, a robust rollback strategy becomes indispensable, allowing organisations to revert to a previous version of software seamlessly.

Consider the incident in March 2017, where personal data of hundreds of millions of individuals was stolen from Equifax, a major credit reporting agency in the United States (Fruhlinger, 2020).  This incident, which compromised the assessment of the financial health of nearly everyone nationwide, might have been mitigated with an effective rollback procedure in place.  However, as Fellows (2023) highlights, rollbacks are not without risks.  While they offer a crucial safety net for software development teams, enabling swift issue resolution post-deployment, they can also complicate matters.  Mismanaged rollback attempts can exacerbate issues, leading to significant financial ramifications and eroding customer trust and satisfaction.

In essence, preparing a comprehensive rollback strategy is crucial for addressing IT failures effectively.  This process involves a detailed focus on multiple factors such as:

-starting with careful planning and documentation of rollback procedures to ensure all steps are clear and executable

-conducting trials to simulate rollback scenarios to identify potential issues before they occur in a live environment

-establishing robust communication channels to ensure all teams are aligned and informed during rollback actions

-regularly updating and testing rollback documentation to keep the strategy relevant and effective

-learning from previous IT failures by analysing the root causes and outcomes to provide invaluable insights for future preparedness and

-monitoring rollback performance to help identify areas for improvement and enhance system resilience.

By integrating these elements into the rollback strategy, organisations can strengthen their capacity to handle IT failures, thereby safeguarding operational continuity and maintaining stakeholder trust (Fellows, 2023).

## Development Team Project Report

[Unit 6 Development Team Project Report: Airbnb business analysis using a data science approach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mJ-__9TzhgBQ5gXbwDcHHig4eIiA2RP4E03JssAH6yE/edit?tab=t.0)

**Development Team Project: Project Report**

**Nikos Archontas, Fabian Narel, Matilda Nilsson, João Torres and Maryum Rasool**



**Introduction**

The rise of online platforms like Airbnb has transformed the hotel industry by giving customers more control over pricing, reviews, and location research (Sharma & Gupta, 2021). Airbnb has become a top accommodation option worldwide, especially in New York City (Jiao & Bai, 2019). This report analyzes Airbnb listings in NYC, focusing on pricing, availability, location, reviews, and property types. Understanding these factors can help Airbnb optimize pricing and improve guest engagement.

**1.	Proposed Business Analytic Question**

Which NYC neighborhood had the highest average Airbnb listing price in 2019, and what factors contributed to its high pricing? Additionally, is there a statistical relationship between Airbnb prices and the number of reviews a listing receives?

**2.	Data Analysis**

Data Preprocessing

The dataset initially contained 48,895 rows and 16 columns. We removed records with zero reviews, zero prices, and extreme outliers. After preprocessing, the dataset was reduced to 38,833 entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The number of Airbnb listings by neighborhood groups showed that Manhattan had the highest number of listings, closely followed by Brooklyn. Staten Island and the Bronx had considerably fewer listings (Figure 1).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f04a6a6-7cc2-47a6-8de3-a7fb8b89fad7)

Figure 1: Visualisation of the number of Airbnb listings per neighborhood group

Figure 2: Violin Plot depicting the density and distribution of prices for airbnb listings for each New York neighborhood group in 2019


Manhattan had the highest median price at $150 per night, while the Bronx had the lowest at $65 per night. Summary statistics revealed the overall median price was $142.33, with a standard deviation of $196.99, indicating significant price differences across listings (Figure 2, Figure 3).

Figure 3: Descriptive statistics on the dataset, achieved through the data.describe command.


In Manhattan and Brooklyn, room type had a significant impact on pricing. Entire homes and apartments had a moderate positive correlation with price (r=0.476), while private rooms had a negative correlation (r=-0.450), supporting the preference for privacy in these neighborhoods (Perez-Sanchez et al., 2019). Longitude also showed a negative correlation with price, reflecting Manhattan's property value decline from expensive areas like SoHo to more affordable locations like East Harlem (Coles et al., 2017) (Figure 4). The number of reviews had a weak correlation with price.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf381ab-4195-4526-8598-9f463713d305)

Box plots confirmed that Entire Home/Apartment listings had more than double the median price of Private and Shared rooms. The number of reviews had no significant impact on price. Minimum nights had a weak correlation with price, showing lower prices for properties that allowed single-night stays (Figure 5).

Figure 6: Histogram of nightly prices for NYC Airbnb listings (prices capped at $1000).



The distribution of NYC Airbnb prices was highly skewed, with most listings priced under $1,000, though a few luxury properties exceeded $10,000. The median price was inflated by high-end properties. The market reflected a mix of budget and premium options, with 75% of listings allowing stays of five nights or fewer (Figure 6).

Expensive listings tend to have fewer reviews, suggesting lower booking frequency. In the 2019 NYC data, the weak negative correlation (r ≈ -0.058, p ≈ 2.6×10⁻³⁷) indicates that budget-friendly listings attract more guests and reviews, while high-priced ones cater to a niche market (Martinez et al., 2017). This aligns with research on tourism demand dynamics, where lower prices can boost occupancy, but higher prices reduce the guest pool (Toader et al., 2022).

Figure 7: Visualisation of scatter plot of price vs. number of reviews


The scatter plot (Figure 7) supports this, showing a dense cluster of low-priced, well-reviewed listings and scattered high-priced listings with few reviews. Many expensive listings had 0–5 reviews, reflecting rare bookings. This reinforces the price-occupancy trade-off, where lower prices attract more bookings, while higher prices target fewer guests. Price showed minimal correlation with other features, aside from the slight negative link with reviews.


Machine Learning Analysis

To further explore patterns at the neighborhood level, we performed K-Means clustering on neighborhoods based on average price and average number of reviews per listing as well as linear regression to examine the relationship between prices and various predictors, including neighborhood group, number of reviews, and host listing count, with the idea to determine whether these factors impact price (Schroeder et al., 2017).


Linear Regression

The linear regression model tests whether neighborhood group, reviews, and host listing count influence price. While statistically significant (F = 205.263, p < 0.001), it explains only 9.3% of price variance (R² = 0.093), indicating many unaccounted factors (Chatterjee & Hadi, 2006). The high RMSE (112.457) reflects substantial predictive error. We reject the null hypothesis, confirming that at least one predictor impacts price (Field, 2024).

Table 2: Regression table highlighting the effects individuals have on price


The analysis confirms significant price differences among neighborhood groups, with Manhattan and Brooklyn commanding higher prices than the Bronx. Listings with more reviews tend to have lower prices, indicating budget-friendly properties attract more guests (Perez-Sanchez et al., 2018; Coles et al., 2017), while "reviews per month" had no significant impact.
Linear regression identifies neighborhood groups as a key price predictor, with Manhattan and Brooklyn as premium markets. However, its low explanatory power (R² = 9.3%) suggests future models should include factors like room type, amenities, seasonality, and demand for better accuracy (Chatterjee & Hadi, 2006; Schroeder et al., 2017).


K-Means Clustering

Performing K-Means clustering on NYC neighborhoods based on average price and number of reviews to segment the market into three distinct groups:

●	Cluster 1 – "Luxury Markets": High price, low reviews. Representing about 1% of neighborhoods, these areas have ultra-expensive listings with minimal bookings, catering to an exclusive clientele (e.g., Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island).

●	Cluster 2 – "Mid-Range Markets": Moderate price, moderate reviews. The largest group (79%) includes areas like Manhattan and Brooklyn, offering moderately priced listings with steady guest traffic (e.g., popular parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan).

●	Cluster 3 – "Budget-Friendly/High-Occupancy": Lower price, high reviews. Comprising 20% of neighborhoods, these areas attract budget travelers and high occupancy, with listings priced under $100 and many reviews (e.g., East Elmhurst, Queens).

These clusters represent different market segments, from high-end to budget-friendly options, and illustrate varying pricing strategies and guest demands across the city.

Figure 8: Visualisation of K-means clustering of neighborhoods


The cluster visualization (Figure 8) shows three distinct groups: budget (low-price, high-review), mid-range (moderate price and reviews), and luxury (high-price, low-reviews). This segmentation offers strategic insights for Airbnb hosts and stakeholders. Hosts in mid-range areas should differentiate their listings to stand out, while budget hosts should focus on high occupancy and positive reviews. Luxury hosts should emphasize exclusive amenities and experiences. Airbnb can tailor marketing and pricing strategies based on these segments, targeting budget travelers with promotions and luxury segments through niche channels.

**3.	Findings and Recommendations**

Airbnb has significant growth potential in New York City. The dataset reveals high demand near major landmarks, which could be leveraged to increase profits by targeting accommodations in these areas. Additionally, offering a mix of premium housing in high-demand sectors and smaller rooms in less popular areas could help Airbnb remain competitive through dynamic pricing. By tracking location-specific trends and local events, Airbnb can better plan promotional offers tailored to neighborhoods and hot spots.

**4.	Conclusion**

This report identifies key business opportunities in New York City for Airbnb, including targeted marketing strategies and revenue optimization. By focusing on specific areas, Airbnb can enhance customer satisfaction and increase revenue. The report also demonstrates the use of data analysis and machine learning for strategic decision-making and business growth.
