## Collaborative Discussion


### Initial & summary posts


**Initial Post**

**Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.  Your post could consider a range of impacts of the failure, including: the implications to customers, the economic cost, the reputational cost, or any other relevant impacts.**

‘System failure is a system that fails to develop or does so in a stunted fashion’ (Carlsson and Jacobsson ,1997 in Bergek et al., 2008).   The first six months of 2018, the national IT systems across the NHS in Wales experienced such system failures as a total of 21 outages took place resulting in various disruptions for GPs, health care staff and patients (Postelnicu, 2018).   

These IT system failures in the Welsh NHS affected appointments, prescriptions and in general the health care provision as the professionals were unable to access electronic patients records for several hours (Donnely, 2018).   Moreover, patients could not book or re-book or cancel their appointments, nor be given test results, whereas GPs could not have access to blood and X-Ray results (BBC, 2018).  Dr Peter Saul, of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said: "Today, IT systems are as critical to clinicians as stethoscopes and scanners. Data outages can be extraordinarily disruptive for practices and for patients’ (Geraint, 2018).

As Schwab (2016) pointed out the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we are now experiencing, is a distinct one compared to the previous as for three components: velocity, scope, and systems impact.  System interdependencies can result in disrupting daily life and industries in every country.  On top of that, there may be a widespread feeling among the population that the extensive availability and circulation of high volumes of both structured and unstructured data has a negative impact on our inner lives and therefore we may lose control over them.
By interdependency is meant ‘a bidirectional relationship between two infrastructures through which the state of each infrastructure influences or is correlated to the state of the other’.  This is why, ‘[…] identifying, understanding, and analysing such interdependencies are significant challenges’, exacerbated by the breadth and complexity of critical IT nationwide infrastructures (Rinaldi et al., 2001).

The Welsh NHS IT system failures had to do with infrastructures which share cyber interdependency (Rinaldi et al., 2001), meaning that their state depends on information transmitted through the information infrastructure.  Eventually, such weaknesses in system structure may lead to interaction failures (related to networks) and to institutional failures (related to institutions) as it was the case of the Welsh NHS outages and may have an impact on the public trust towards state actors and operators.

Realising to what extent governments and public or private databases are vulnerable to failures or to external threats is crucial for how public policies will take shape and public goods will be delivered to citizens in the future.  Concerns about the vulnerability may even make countries roll back their initial plans for full replacement of the physical dimension into the digital one.  ‘Sweden and Norway are backpedalling on plans for cashless societies over fears that fully digital payment systems would leave them vulnerable to Russian security threats, and concern for those unable to use them.  Prolonged power cuts, system failures or digital attacks on payment systems and banks could leave cash as the only alternative that is easily available’ (Bryant, 2024).

**Summary post**

System failures occur when systems fail to develop adequately or remain underdeveloped (Carlsson and Jacobsson, 1997 in Bergek et al., 2008).  In early 2018, the NHS in Wales encountered 21 critical IT system outages, disrupting services for GPs, healthcare staff, and patients (Postelnicu, 2018).  These disruptions hindered access to electronic patient records, affecting appointments, prescriptions, and healthcare delivery (Donnely, 2018).  Patients struggled with booking or cancelling appointments and obtaining test results, while GPs couldn’t access blood test and X-ray data (BBC, 2018).  Dr. Peter Saul from the Royal College of GPs in Wales emphasised the criticality of IT systems to clinical practice, warning of significant disruptions from data outages (Geraint, 2018).

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by unprecedented speed, scope, and systemic impact, leading to complex interdependencies across systems that can disrupt lives and industries globally (Schwab, 2016).  Nevertheless, there is rising concern over how extensive data availability affects personal control and privacy.

Interdependency is defined as ‘a bidirectional relationship between two infrastructures through which the state of each infrastructure influences or is correlated to the state of the other’ (Rinaldi et al., 2001). These connections pose challenges due to the complexity of national IT infrastructures.

The Welsh NHS IT system failures had to do with infrastructures which share cyber interdependency (Rinaldi et al., 2001), meaning that their state depends on information transmitted through the information infrastructure.  Eventually, such weaknesses in system structure may lead to interaction failures (related to networks) and to institutional failures (related to institutions) as it was the case of the Welsh NHS outages and may have an impact on the public trust towards state actors and operators.

However, our infrastructure was already heavily technologised and interdependent nearly 25 years ago, with risks of disruptions cascading across sectors, making it clear that vulnerabilities were present even in the early stages of digital reliance (Rinaldi et al., 2001).  The point is that today, due to the rapid technological advances, such as data integration and cyber-based systems, these complexities are largely amplified (Schwab, 2016).

A key challenge is modernising legacy systems necessary for organisations yet obsolete for Industry 4.0 (Venâncio et al., 2022).  Although Industry 4.0 offers clear benefits, high transformation costs hinder adoption.  Updating systems is vital but complicated by system evolution and integration (Clarke et al., 2024).

Understanding vulnerabilities is vital for future policy development and public service delivery.  Concerns over these vulnerabilities could prompt reconsideration of digital transitions, as seen in Sweden and Norway's re-evaluation of cashless societies due to security threats and accessibility issues (Bryant, 2024).

### Response to my peers' posts


Thanks, Elias, for your insightful post on the data breaches, affecting, in particular, government-run databases, which may be due to cyber-attacks or just IT system failures.   

As Yuchong L. et al. (2021) put it, governments nowadays due to the interconnected cyberspace, we are interacting with, are confronted with multiple and much more complex safety risks than in the past.  For instance, the concept of security is not only military threat to internal or external borders.  The character of the cyber threats and IT systems failure is such that the geographical dimension is not relevant.  In other words, a cyber threat and attack can come from a state or non-state actor far away from the national boundaries.  ‘These threats are sporadic, multidimensional, and because they are associated with sensitive networks and infrastructure, their level of damage is very high’.  This kind of threat requires a different response from governments and private actors alike, which has mainly to do with investing more on IT infrastructure.  Such resources should aim at preserving the databases intact, avoiding as much as possible data leakages and mitigating the impacts if such data breaches or cyber-attacks take place.

Similarly, the National Audit Office in the UK pointed out that changes in the digital service delivery “have mainly focused on improvements to the citizen’s online experience ... Without a deeper understanding of digital transformation, senior leaders often focus on tactical solutions and quick fixes and avoid addressing the underlying inefficiencies that contribute to driving future costs” (Fishenden J. 2024).  The changes referred to, among others, could include designing ‘scalable, secure and resilient systems’. 

On the same issue, Booth R. (2025) concludes that state actors will find it very difficult to successfully address the lack of advanced digital and cyber-skills in the public sector workforce, enhance accountability for cyber-attacks and ‘better manage the risks posed by legacy IT’.  This is why policy and digital transformation need to go hand in hand and be ‘co-designed — managed, developed, and adapted together to reflect and respond to an ever-changing political, legal, social, and economic landscape’.

Dear Jaco,

your insight into IT system failures highlights a critical dimension:  IT failures and data breaches often result not only from cyber-attacks and cyber-threats but also from hastily implemented fixes and insufficiently tested releases.  As you argue in your post, this failure underscores the risks of prioritising rapid release cycles and depending on addressing issues as they emerge in production (Khern-am-nuai, 2024), all in the pursuit of faster time-to-market for competitive advantage.  In such scenarios, a robust rollback strategy becomes indispensable, allowing organisations to revert to a previous version of software seamlessly.

Consider the incident in March 2017, where personal data of hundreds of millions of individuals was stolen from Equifax, a major credit reporting agency in the United States (Fruhlinger, 2020).  This incident, which compromised the assessment of the financial health of nearly everyone nationwide, might have been mitigated with an effective rollback procedure in place.  However, as Fellows (2023) highlights, rollbacks are not without risks.  While they offer a crucial safety net for software development teams, enabling swift issue resolution post-deployment, they can also complicate matters.  Mismanaged rollback attempts can exacerbate issues, leading to significant financial ramifications and eroding customer trust and satisfaction.

In essence, preparing a comprehensive rollback strategy is crucial for addressing IT failures effectively.  This process involves a detailed focus on multiple factors such as:

-starting with careful planning and documentation of rollback procedures to ensure all steps are clear and executable

-conducting trials to simulate rollback scenarios to identify potential issues before they occur in a live environment

-establishing robust communication channels to ensure all teams are aligned and informed during rollback actions

-regularly updating and testing rollback documentation to keep the strategy relevant and effective

-learning from previous IT failures by analysing the root causes and outcomes to provide invaluable insights for future preparedness and

-monitoring rollback performance to help identify areas for improvement and enhance system resilience.

By integrating these elements into the rollback strategy, organisations can strengthen their capacity to handle IT failures, thereby safeguarding operational continuity and maintaining stakeholder trust (Fellows, 2023).
