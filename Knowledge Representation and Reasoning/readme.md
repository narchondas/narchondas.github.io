## Learning outcomes


### In the module Knowledge Representation and Reasoning I shall:

*Discuss how to define knowledge and explain the concept of KRR and its relationship to data and information.
  
*Gain an appreciation of the importance and rationale for employing formal approaches to KRR.

*Demonstrate an understanding of the basics of logic and its application to KRR problems.

*Acquire an understanding of the professional competence required to able be to identify and examine KRR technologies for Artificial Intelligence applications.


### On completion of the module Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, I will be able to:

*Critique the need for formal approaches to knowledge representation and reasoning.
  
*Review critically properties of a knowledge-based system.

*Appraise critically modelling techniques for knowledge representation and reasoning.

*Examine and incorporate different modelling approaches to solving KRR problems.

## Collaborative discussions

### Initial, summary posts & response to peers' posts


### Collaborative Discussion 1


**Initial Post**

**Knowledge Representation is a recent phenomenon â€“ it only became a topic of discussion with the development of computing technology and the need to represent knowledge in computer systems. Discuss this assertion. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Justify your position, supported with at least two academics references.  How is reasoning related to knowledge representation (KR)? Is KR still useful without reasoning support? Justify your answer supported by two academic references.**
