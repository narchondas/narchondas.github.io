## MSc. Artificial Intelligence Cohort July 2024

## Professional bio
I am an expert in Better Regulation and in particular in Stakeholder Engagement. Since 2018, I have been working on European Commission's evaluations, impact assessments and stakeholder consultations. 

As Bellevue programme fellow in the SGMAP (2016-2017), I had the opportunity to work in the French public administration and deal with a different and challenging administrative and e-government context. 

As team leader and project manager, working in the Greek Ministry of Interior (2002-2016), I had the opportunity to lead several political and technical structural reform and e-government projects aiming at the modernisation of the Greek public administration. 

The administrative reform process is a magnificent ‘journey’ full of excitement, setbacks but also of great achievements which better the lives of the European citizens.
