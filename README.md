## MSc. Artificial Intelligence Cohort July 2024

## Professional bio

I am an expert in Better Regulation, with a particular focus on Stakeholder Engagement. Since 2018, I have been contributing to the European Commission's work on evaluations, impact assessments, and public consultations, supporting evidence-based policymaking at the EU level.

In 2016–2017, I was honoured to serve as a Bellevue Programme fellow within SGMAP (France’s Secretariat-General for Government Modernisation). This experience offered me first-hand exposure to the French public administration and its digital transformation challenges, enriching my comparative perspective on administrative innovation in Europe.

From 2002 to 2016, I held leadership roles in the Greek Ministry of Interior, acting as team leader and programme manager on numerous structural reform and e-government initiatives. These programmes were instrumental in the modernisation of the Greek public administration and the delivery of improved public services.

I view administrative reform as a continuous and inspiring journey — one marked by challenges and achievements, and above all, by its capacity to improve the everyday lives of European citizens.
